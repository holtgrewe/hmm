# Coin toss example


Lets say that we have 2 coins:
  * Fair which generates H (Head) and T (Tails) with probability of 1/2
  * Biased - with probabilities H: 1/4, T: 3/4

We also know that after each toss we can switch coin with the probability of
  * Use the same coin: 3/4
  * Switch coin: 1/4

First time we select coin with probability of 1/2

Question: If we now get observation of H H T T T which coins were used during each toss?
